# About FastEdgy

## Our Philosophy

FastEdgy was born from the need to streamline internal projects as well as those created for our clients into a
common foundation. The goal was to have a base that we master perfectly, with a technical opinion that we love,
while using excellent existing packages or creating our own in order to keep things simple.

It was never designed to compete with or steal the market from anyone. In fact, the Krafter team designed
FastEdgy as a complement to the current Python ecosystem, with an approach that seems common at first glance,
but different in implementation.

## The Vision

FastEdgy combines the power of **FastAPI** for modern API development with **Edgy ORM** for database
management, creating a cohesive foundation that:

- **Streamlines development** with opinionated but flexible conventions
- **Reduces boilerplate** through intelligent code generation
- **Maintains simplicity** while providing advanced features
- **Respects the ecosystem** by building on proven technologies

## Core Principles

- **Convention over Configuration**: Sensible defaults that work out of the box
- **Developer Experience First**: Tools and patterns that make development enjoyable
- **Production Ready**: Built for real-world applications from day one
- **Community Driven**: Open source with community contributions welcome

## The Team

FastEdgy was originally created by **[Krafter](https://krafter.io)**, a team of passionate developers who
believe in building tools that make developers' lives easier.

## License

FastEdgy is released under the **[MIT License](https://github.com/krafterio/fastedgy/blob/main/LICENSE)**.
