# Container Service

A centralized dependency injection system that makes FastAPI development simpler by automatically managing service dependencies.

## Why Container Service?

FastAPI's `Depends()` system is excellent for request-scoped dependencies. FastEdgy's Container Service builds on this foundation to simplify application-level services that live beyond individual requests.

While FastAPI handles request-specific data beautifully, managing application services (databases, caches, email services) often requires repetitive provider functions:

```python
# FastAPI approach - works great but requires setup
def get_database():
    return DatabaseService("postgresql://...")

def get_email_service(db: DatabaseService = Depends(get_database)):
    return EmailService(db)

@app.post("/users")
async def create_user(
    user_data: dict,
    db: DatabaseService = Depends(get_database),
    email: EmailService = Depends(get_email_service)
):
    # Each service needs its provider function
```

Container Service adds a layer of convenience for these application services, automatically resolving their dependencies:

```python
# Container Service - built on FastAPI's foundation
from fastedgy.dependencies import Inject

@app.post("/users")
async def create_user(
    user_data: dict,
    email: EmailService = Inject(EmailService)  # Auto-resolved!
):
    # Dependencies resolved automatically, no provider functions needed
```

## Key Benefits

- **Zero boilerplate** - No provider functions needed
- **Automatic resolution** - Dependencies resolved recursively
- **Application singletons** - Services persist across requests
- **Unified access** - Same services in API, CLI, and background tasks
- **Full FastAPI compatibility** - Built on native dependency system

## When to Use Container Service

**Perfect for:**

- Database connections and configurations
- Email services, caches, external APIs
- Services shared across endpoints
- Application-level singletons

**Not needed for:**

- Simple request-scoped data
- FastAPI's built-in features (authentication, etc.)
- One-off utilities
