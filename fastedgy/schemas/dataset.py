    Schema for resequencing records within a list while allowing group reassignment.

    This schema enables the reorganization of records in a list by providing
    the ability to specify a new grouping field/value and define the desired
    order of all list records through their IDs.

    Attributes:
        model_name: str: The name of the model to resequence.
        sequence_field (str | None): The field name used for sequencing records. Value must be defined to resequence.
        sequence_offset (int | None): The offset to apply to the sequence.
        group_field (str | None): The field name used for grouping records. Value must be defined to update group.
        group_value (Any | None): The new value to assign to the group field.
        ids (list[int]): List of record IDs in the desired order.
